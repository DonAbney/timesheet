For development, use apiary endpoints.  Those endpoints will eventually be proxies to the prod endpoints, so the apiary urls can remain in the code.

Note: Complexity has increased to an uncomfortable level (given no test coverage to this point).  Time to start adding some automated tooling, tests, and frameworks.  Currently thinking node.js with express and grunt.
